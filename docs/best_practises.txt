Best Practices for Python Project Structure following by ChatGPT

✅ Use Virtual Environments
Keep dependencies isolated with venv or poetry.
sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)

✅ Follow a Naming Convention
Use snake_case for file names and PascalCase for classes.

✅ Separate Business Logic & Configuration
Keep secrets/configs in .env or config.yaml.

✅ Write Tests
Store them in the /tests directory and use pytest.

✅ Document Everything
Use README.md for a project overview and docstrings for functions.
